# XRPC
An Xcode Rich Presence utility app. 

## Why
There's already a few other RPC apps out there. But they come with a few caveats, namely that they rely on AppleScript to poll Xcode.

XRPC instead uses Accessibility APIs which work better and also i think applescript launches xcode a lot out of nowhere lol
